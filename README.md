# Burnable Fabric

Adds back Fabric's pre-Satisfactory 1.0 energy value of 15 MJ and re-enables burning it in Biomass Generators.

_If you enjoy my work, please consider donating to my [completely optional tip jar](https://ko-fi.com/robb4)._

You can change the energy value of Fabric by adjusting the
[mod savegame setting](https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/latest/ForUsers/ConfiguringMods.html#_mod_savegame_settings).
The supported range is 0 MJ to 1,500,000 MJ (Plutonium Fuel Rod).

Important notes:

- Biomass generators constructed before the mod was installed may need to be rebuilt to accept Fabric
- Fabric will not appear in the "Supported Fuel Types" tab of the Biomass Generator UI


Thanks Drewbacca for the custom mod icon!
